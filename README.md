# Traffic Light Controller VHDL Project

![Traffic Light Controller](traffic_light_controller_image.png)

## Overview

This VHDL project implements a sophisticated Traffic Light Controller system using Xilinx Vivado for FPGA programming. The project includes a state-of-the-art state machine to manage various traffic scenarios, providing reliable and responsive control for traffic lights and pedestrian crossings.

## Features

- **Traffic Light Sequences:** Standard traffic light sequences, including STOP, READY, GO, and SLOWDOWN phases.
  
- **Pedestrian Crossing:** A responsive pedestrian crossing mechanism triggered by the pedestrian request signal.

- **Flexible Configuration:** Designed for flexibility, allowing easy adjustment of clock frequency and timing parameters to meet specific FPGA and application requirements.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Traffic-Light-Controller-VHDL.git

### 2. Open in Xilinx Vivado
Import the project into Xilinx Vivado.
Customize the VHDL code or parameters based on your specific needs.

### 3. Simulate and Program FPGA
Utilize Vivado's simulation tools to verify functionality.
Program the FPGA with the synthesized design.

### 4. Integration
Integrate the Traffic Light Controller into your larger FPGA-based system or use it as a standalone module.
